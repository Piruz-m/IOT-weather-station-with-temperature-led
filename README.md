# IOT-weather-station-with-temperature-led
This project uses node mcu. A DHT 11 temperature sensor is connected to measure temperature, humidity and calculates the humiture(heat index) based on that data. An RGB Led is used to indicate the intensity of temperature between 20 and 40 degrees Celcius. The higher the temperature is, the higher is the intensity of red light and the lower the temperature is, the higher is the intensity of the blue light. The esp8266 is connected to hotspot and the data is sent to an IOT platform- thingspeak. On this platform, the data is analyzed and plotted onto separate graphs. This data can be accessed from any device at any distance from the mcu, as long as it is connected to a hotspot, which is its major advantage over Bluetooth, which has a specific range and where nothing can be uploaded on a server.
