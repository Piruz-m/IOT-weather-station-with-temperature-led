# IOT-weather-station-with-temperature-led
This project uses node mcu. A DHT 11 temperature sensor is connected to measure temperature and humidity. The humiture(heat index) is calculated based on that data. This data is displayed on the serial monitor. An RGB Led is used to indicate the intensity of temperature ranged between 20 and 40 degrees Celcius to give a general idea of what the temperature is at a glance. The higher the temperature is, the higher is the intensity of red light and the lower the temperature is, the higher is the intensity of the blue light. The esp8266 on the node mcu board is connected to hotspot and the data is sent to an IOT platform- thingspeak by mathworks. On this platform, the data is analyzed and plotted onto separate graphs. This data can be accessed from any computer or mobile device with internet at any distance from the mcu, as long as it is connected to a hotspot, which is its major advantage over Bluetooth, which has a specific range and where nothing can be uploaded on a server.
